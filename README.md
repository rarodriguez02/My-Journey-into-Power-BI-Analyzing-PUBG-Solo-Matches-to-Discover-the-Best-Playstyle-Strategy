# My-Journey-into-Power-BI-Analyzing-PUBG-Solo-Matches-to-Discover-the-Best-Playstyle-Strategy
In this case study, I explore data analysis using Power BI by examining a PUBG: Battlegrounds dataset to identify the best solo playstyle. With no prior Power BI experience, I learned to clean, transform, and visualize data to uncover key insights.

By analyzing 179,533 players across 7,971 matches, I identified strong correlations between kills, damage, movement, and winning. I developed a player classification model—Passive, Balanced, and Aggressive—revealing that aggressive players had the highest win rate at 22%.

This study showcases my journey in mastering Power BI and applying data-driven analysis to real-world scenarios.
